# Installation steps

## General Setup
Simply remove all other conflicting bank robbery scripts within Fleeca Banks. Drag and drop brazzers-bankrobbery into your resource folder.

DO NOT rename any file contents for installation. The script is using CFX Escrow System and will not work if your file is renamed.

Navigate to shared/shared.lua file and modify your config. Each config is unique to each user. Carefully read the notes provided for each option
and modify the values to your needs.

YOU WILL need to modify the doorIds for each door at each bank to your servers door Ids. If you use qb-doorlocks I have provided a doorlock file for all doorlocks needed for GabZ Fleeca. This will give you a jump start for those doorIds
